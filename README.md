# Joon Park's Writing Portfolio

This portfolio was inspired by DeepSeek-R1 and its documentation. While I like DeepSeek's documentation, I wrote material that I thought might help a reader who is newer to large language models.

This repository contains three documents:
1. [deepseek-r1-intro.md](/deepseek-r1-intro.md): introduction to and quick-start guide for DeepSeek-R1
2. [deepseek-r1-local.md](/deepseek-r1-local.md): procedure for running DeepSeek-R1 locally
3. [prompt-style-guide.md](/prompt-style-guide.md): hypothetical style guide that is consistent with and applicable to the previous two documents

While some of the content in these documents is a reorganization of existing documentation (such as inclusion of the "Multi-round Conversation" section in deepseek-r1-intro.md), the writing is original and a culmination of research.

The only things that I have directly pulled from existing documentation are the hardware specification table in deepseek-r1-local.md, the diagram in deepseek-r1-intro.md, and the coding samples (most of which have been modified to fit the flow of my documentation).
